## Development Locales

As part of our translation process, we need to know which keys are used per page to identify their translation value. To do so, we have a “hidden” `dev` language which can be accessed directly in our webpage.

The keys are generated by pasting the locales in a console and running the following command:

```javascript
var locale = { name: 'about', value: {...} }
var genDevLocale = (locale) => Object.keys(locale.value).reduce((acc, curr) => {
  acc[curr] = typeof locale.value[curr] === 'object' ? Object.keys(locale.value[curr]).reduce((newAcc, newCurr) => {
    newAcc[newCurr] = `${locale.name}_${curr}_${newCurr}`;
      return newAcc;
    },
  {}) : `${locale.name}_${curr}`;
  return acc;
},
{})
var devLocale = genDevLocale(locale)
```
