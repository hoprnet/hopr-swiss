    At HOPR, we take cyber security seriously. HOPR is an IT consultancy with its own in-house development team. If you need to secure your company’s data, or the data you receive from your
    clients, HOPR has you covered.
    <br />
    What makes us different?
    There are many data storage solutions, either on-site or in the cloud. But
    the real problems arise when data is transferred. HOPR ensures that data can
    be sent and received safely, easily and with no risk of data leaks. We consult with companies and institutions and provide solutions for all
    their data problems.

    The number of innovations is increasing every day and so is the amount of
    data harvested about us. We have the dream that digitalization can improve
    our lives without costing us all of our privacy. We have the dream that
    everyone should be able to make decisions in their lives as freely and
    uninfluenced as possible. And we are sure that Blockchain is not just a hype
    but an impactful solution to this very problem. This is what we set out for
    and why we are constantly looking for ways to improve the privacy standards
    in the digital world. Yes, we’re aware that we can’t change the world alone.
    So we created HOPR as a swiss association which belongs not to one, but all,
    making us independent, incorruptible and indestructible.Everyone can become
    a part of HOPR – either working on the protocol or using it as a basis for
    their own product. Our community is a vivid organism consisting of different
    people sharing the same goal:<b> Changing data privacy for good</b>
